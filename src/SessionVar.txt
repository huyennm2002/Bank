In the dashboard page (Dashboard.html) we are displaying the following information:
1)Name 2)Account Type 3)AID# 4)Balance
After login is successful, the sigin in "Signup.php" following session variables must be set so that we can display their values:

$_SESSION['loginSuccessful'] = True;
$_SESSION['id'] = CID;
$_SESSION['name'] = Name;
$_SESSION['accountType'] = Account Type;
$_SESSION['aid'] = AID;
$_SESSION['balance'] = Balance;
$_SESSION['profileImage'] = profileImage;
$_SESSION['imageType'] = imageType;

If login is successful further all pages and queries related to customer depends on CID#, also fill all remaining variables, if login fails set the value 'loginSuccessful' = False; Do not set remaining variables.
